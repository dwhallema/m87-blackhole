Description:

(Left image) M87 galaxy supermassive black hole polarization lines plotted over a total intensity image, showing the magnetic fields at the edge of the black hole. This composite image was published in an article entitled: "First M87 Event Horizon Telescope Results. VII. Polarization of the Ring" by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration et al. (2021). It shows 1.3 mm wavelength observations shaped as an asymmetric ring-like source morphology, resulting from the synchrotron emission produced by relativistic plasma located near the black hole. 

(Right image) Same image enhanced by (1) subtracting the 50-pixel radial median, thereby improving the visibility of details smaller than the radial pixel threshold, and (2) aggressive contrast processing based on the full range of spatial frequencies (Mantiuk et al., 2006). The purpose of this enhancement is to increase the visibility of detailed patterns. 

Q \& A:

* <em>Is this peer-reviewed?</em> No. 

* <em>Do the colors represent the same thing in both images?</em> No. The new image (right) is a filtered and contrast-enhanced version of the original EHT Collaboration et al. composite image (left), consequently the colors represent different composite values in both images. See description. 

* <em>Why does the new image contain noise?</em> Filtering and contrast processing not only enhanced signal patterns, but also increased the visibility of quantization errors and 8x8 pixel JPEG block compression artefacts. See description.
